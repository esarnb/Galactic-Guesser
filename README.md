# Galactic Guesser

Welcome to Galactic Guesser! Each planet contains a value, and you must match your score to the goal. The catch is, you must match it perfectly...if you go over, you lose! 

Want to try it out? [Play it here!](https://esarnb.github.io/unit-4-game/)

## Getting Started

To play this on your local machine, you may download all folders and the index.html. Open the index.html with your preferred browser to start playing the game.


### Installing

To deploy on a live system, such as your website, you will need a web server [like Apache2 for Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-apache-web-server-on-ubuntu-16-04).

Then place the folders and files in the subfolder of your choice within the html root directory.

That's it!
